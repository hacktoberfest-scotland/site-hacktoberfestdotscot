  title: Get Your Ticket For Hacktoberfest Scotland
  content: |
    This event is organised by Craig Porteous and Paul Broadwith. This is the third year we have organised and hosted a #Hacktoberfest event but this one will be a little different.

    Everyone who signs up will receive a Microsoft Teams invite within 48 hours or registering in October so you can jump in and chat, share and learn all month, not just during the event.
