    So, you want to contribute to an open source project, or you want to start your own open source project...


    This is great news, and a fantastic opportunity to learn new things and collaborate with other like minded people.


    But how do you get started?


    In this talk we will look at the first steps for both a contributor to an open source project, as we as how to get started as the maintainer of a new open source project.

We will mainly be focused on how to get started using GitHub, however, the guidelines provided in this talk are applicable to other places like GitLab, BitBucket, etc.'
