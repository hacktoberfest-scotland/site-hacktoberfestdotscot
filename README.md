## About Hacktoberfest Scotland

Hacktoberfest Scotland is organised by [Craig Porteous](https://github.com/cporteou) and [Paul Broadwith](https://github.com/pauby) to encourage community collaboration around open source projects and encourage those new to open source, git source control, and the hacktoberfest event to get involved and take part.

The event is an annual one, founded in 2017.
